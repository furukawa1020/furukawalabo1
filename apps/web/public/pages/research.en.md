# Physiological Reaction & Subjective Meaning
**—— How far can science handle the diversity of meaning-making?**

![Research Plan](/images/research_poster_v2.png)

## Overview
Even with the same physiological reaction, people interpret it as different meanings such as anxiety or challenge. This research premises this variability and does not aim to accurately measure or estimate physiological reactions themselves, but treats them as a "structure where differences in meaning-making arise." Through meta-review and analysis of existing physiology-subjectivity datasets, we organize the conditions under which the relationship between physiological reactions and subjective meaning holds or breaks. Based on these findings, we aim to systematize sensing, algorithms, interfaces, and behavioral changes from the perspective of "meaning-making" and build a "Science of Meaning-Making."

## Background & Problem
* Cortisol and HRV are widely used as stress indicators, but the same reaction can have different meanings for different people (e.g., anxiety vs. challenge).
* Questionnaires and post-hoc verbal reports are difficult to capture the differences in meaning-making and the process of reappraisal.
* As a result, physiological reactions are minimized to a single label, fixing the premise that "stress = bad."
* This also leads to social losses such as absenteeism, leave of absence, and presenteeism.

**Research Approach**:
1. Organize conditions for the establishment/failure of "Physiology-Subjectivity Correspondence" via Meta-Review.
2. Verify "discrepancies" using public data (WESAD, etc.).
3. Make differences in meaning-making observable using Externalization Interfaces.

## Hypotheses (H1–H3)
* **H1 (Theory/Meta-Review)**: The correspondence between physiological reactions and subjective meaning is not one-to-one, but there are conditions for establishment/failure depending on context and individual differences.
* **H2 (Data/WESAD)**: Subjective labels do not correspond uniquely to the same physiological reaction pattern (Invariance is broken).
* **H3 (Interface)**: Externalization makes differences in meaning-making more clearly observable than questionnaires or verbal reports.

## Verification Plan
* **Phase A**: Meta-Review (Condition Organization)
* **Phase B**: WESAD Analysis (Quantitative Verification of Broken Invariance)
* **Phase C**: Externalization Interface (Observation & Comparison Experiment)

## Funding & Social Implementation Plan
* We will build up hypothesis verification on a 10-year scale, with both theory/demonstration (meta-review/public data analysis) and funding/social implementation (clinical/field introduction) as two wheels.
* Application Candidates: CareTech, Mitou Advanced, etc.

## Future Prospects & Message
* We treat the "meaning" of experiences, which is difficult to capture with numerical indicators, through touch and vision, designing it not as "healing" but as a "trigger for self-understanding."
* Creating a society where even those who deviate slightly from "normal" can live easily.
* I want to increase the moments of "I'm glad I'm alive."
