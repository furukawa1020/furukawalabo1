### Message
With both theory/demonstration (meta-review/public data analysis) and funding/social implementation (clinical/field introduction) as two wheels, we aim to build a "Science of Meaning-Making" on a 10-year scale.
Creating a society where even those who deviate slightly from "normal" can live easily.
